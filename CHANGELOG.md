## Comments
This Challenge is the first time I've attempted to build a webpage from scratch just using HTML and CSS. I can read CSS and work out what it's doing but it's much harder when starting from nothing. I found this task hard.

The HTML and CSS for the webpage works but it isn't very elegant. I tried to structure the HTML semantically and make CSS and the Flexbox do the hard work. I arranged the Media Query breakpoints where the layout failed as the viewport reduced. I have more Media Queries than I probably should and they make a lot of changes. 

I've learnt a lot about CSS and the Flexbox but not as much as I'd like.

As I said, hard and very challenging but it was enjoyable
